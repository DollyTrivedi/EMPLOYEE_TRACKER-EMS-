# EMPLOYEE_TRACKER-EMS-
Employee Tracker is a simple employee management system where admins can assign tasks to employees, monitor their work progress, approve or reject leave requests, and view employees' time-in and time-out records. Inspired by real-time HR platforms like Keka, this project offers a basic yet effective solution for managing employee activities.
